Hey, I'm Vincent from Kenya,I do design and frint end development. I like exploring creative ways to deliver content using native CSS, webflow, Figma and wordpress. I have a robust design system for figma that I use to create all of my design projects, for an easier time during development. You can check out my website that's still under development at https://vincentmungai.github.io/portfolio/portfolio.html or some of my design work at https://dribbble.com/Vmungai_ .
